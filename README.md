# Project Overview
In this assignment I acted as a contractor for the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the restaurant ratings across the United Kingdom in order to help their hournalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 

## Analysis 
You will see my findings in the "RP.NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb" file located in the "Starter_Code" file. 

### Instructions to Final Work 
My final work can be found in the "Starter_Code" file, you will reference these two documents: "RP.NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb" and ""RP.NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb". 
I did not work with anyone on this project. I did use Xper Learning Assistant to assist with script writing. 

Thank you!
